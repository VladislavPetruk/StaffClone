              The history of Just Do It began in 2013. The founders - energetic
              and creative guys, brothers from a small town in the western part
              of Ukraine - decided to focus their activities on the development
              of Ukrainian streetwear culture. In the autumn of the same year,
              the first release was a park called Just Do It. She became the
              first swallow in the company's wide range of models developed and
              implemented. Ukrainians supported the youth brand and welcomed the
              appearance of new products.
              <br /><br />
              In 2015, the Just Do It brand's collections included both outerwear and
              footwear. The company's credo is a constant movement forward. With
              each release we set new goals and work for maximum results.
